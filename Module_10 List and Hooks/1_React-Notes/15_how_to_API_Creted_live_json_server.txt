-->What is JSON Server?
->JSON is an acronym for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON Server is a lightweight and easy-to-use Node.js tool that simulates a RESTful API using a JSON file as the data source. With JSON Server, front-end developers can create mock APIs without the need to write complex server-side code, or when a backend API isn't ready yet.

format for :- json
1) array fromat
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 25
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "age": 40
  }
]

2) object with nested object format

{
  "users": {
    "1": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "age": 25
    },
    "2": {
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "age": 30
    }
  }
}


->Features of JSON Server
Here are some of the features of JSON Server:

--->It is easy and quick to set up. It is also user-friendly for front-end developers and newbie 	back-end developers.
--->It supports common HTTP methods like the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, just like a 	real backend API server would.
--->With JSON Server, you can perform Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations on data to 	build an interactive application.
--->JSON Server offers developers the ability to create custom routes to handle more complex 	scenarios.

Benefits of Using JSON Server
Here are some of the benefits of using JSON Server:

JSON Server grants front-end developers the ability to quickly create functional API prototypes that can be tested and modified while waiting for the backend server to be ready.
Front-end developers can use JSON Server to simulate different scenarios, and error cases during testing to enhance their application.

Step #1 - Install JSON Server

npm install -g json-server

step #2 - creted db.json file for out of src

add json data
==> as :- array format use 
  {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "username": "john_doe",
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "password": "password123"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "username": "Dome_Sf",
        "email": "Demo@example.com",
        "password": "password234"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "username": "sfsaf_Sf",
        "email": "sfsaf@example.com",
        "password": "sfsaf23"
      }

    ],
    "contacts": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "phone": "123-456-7890",
        "city": "Gwenborough"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Dome_Sf",
        "email": "Demo@example.com",
        "phone": "242-456-7890",
        "city": "Wisokyburgh"
      }

    ]
  }

step #3 - this is a package.json data in
debug
"script":{
// this will created
 "server":"json-server --watch db.json --port 3000"
}

 "server":"json-server --watch db.json --port 3000"

step #4 - this time terminal cmd use as :- 
npx json-server --watch db.json

and then start npm server use port has been chnage 3001
